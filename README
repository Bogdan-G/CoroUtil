Originally based off of the Minecraft pathfinding code.

Features:
---------

- "Unlimited" pathfind range, tries smaller angles of approach when destination is outside set max full pathfind range
- Interface with callback for custom mobs
- Injects path data if used on vanilla mobs if their default targetting system isnt actively overriding it
- Contains various fixes, eg: fences, doors, logic blocks are dealt with properly now
- Designed to run on a thread
- Uses a queue system to manage pathfind requests

Some Details:
-------------

- Given its threaded in a game I'd rather not edit base classes in, it does some clever 'temp path' stuff while the thread does its work
- When a Pathfind request is made, the entity is given a fake 1 node path immediately that is at placed a few blocks above their heads, this keeps them still and in a pathfinding state, then when the thread has a path ready, it replaces the fake path data on the entity with the real one

Usage:
------

- For custom mobs, c_IEnhPF Interface has a pathfind callback, use setPathExToEntity(...)
- Pathfind to entity: PFQueue.getPath(yourent, target, maxPFRange);
- Pathfind to location: PFQueue.getPath(this, x, y, z, maxPFRange);
- Pathfind to entity TOP PRIORITY: PFQueue.getPath(yourent, target, maxPFRange, -1);
- Pathfind to location TOP PRIORITY: PFQueue.getPath(this, x, y, z, maxPFRange, -1);

- The priorities puts the pathfind call at the top of the queue list, even if there is a queue
- If range is bigger than maxPFRange, up to 5 ~20 block, slightly randomly angled ranged attempts are made aimed towards the destination, if those fail to find a presentable path, it tries a surface level pathfind as well.
- Pathfind calls that take over 5 seconds to get to in the queue are automatically aborted, prevents a buildup of the queue incase you overload it with jobs.
